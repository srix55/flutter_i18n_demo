#### How it works
- The device's locale (language & country code like en-US, en-IN, es-US) is obtained using [flutter_device_locale](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_device_locale)
- App defaults to en-US whenever locale is not supported
- The app locale is held in a [cubit](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/coreconcepts?id=cubit) (a simpler bloc basically)
- Whenever the user language selection changes, the bloc is updated which would rebuild the app with MaterialApp's locale attribute set to the new language, while retaining the regional code

Note that it follows the instructions in [intl](https://pub.dev/packages/intl) to add supported locales and translations

#### Issues  
- flutter: MissingPluginException(No implementation found for method deviceLocales on channel flutter_device_locale)  
```flutter clean```
